   ```
   python ai_news_collector.py
   ```

   ```
   python deploy_to_github.py
   ```

   ```

## Next Steps

The complete source code for this project is available in this repository. The main working repository has been cleaned up and simplified for easier maintenance.

If you'd like to create a new GitHub repository for the full project (beyond just the web app), you can create one called "AI_News_Collector" and push the code from your local repository.

Thank you for using AI News Daily!
