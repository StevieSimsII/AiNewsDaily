AI News Daily Summary
Last Updated: May 15, 2025

AI News Daily is an automated tool that collects and presents the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning news from across the web. The system works by fetching RSS feeds from various technology news sources, filtering the content to ensure it's AI/ML-related, and saving the articles to a CSV file. This collected information is then displayed in a clean, modern web interface that allows users to browse, search, and filter articles based on their interests.

The product features a streamlined web application with a simplified interface that focuses on the essential content. Users can view all collected articles in the "All News" section or learn more about the data sources in the "About" section. The automation runs daily, ensuring fresh content is always available, and the web interface is deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access from anywhere.

The entire update process has been simplified with a one-click update script (OneClickUpdate.ps1) that collects new articles and updates the GitHub Pages website automatically. This makes maintenance effortless and ensures the content stays fresh with minimal intervention.

Updates are now managed by GitHub Actions, which automatically deploys changes whenever the repository is updated. This ensures that the website is always up-to-date with the latest articles and changes.

This tool is particularly valuable for professionals who need to stay updated on AI developments without spending time manually searching multiple news sources each day.
