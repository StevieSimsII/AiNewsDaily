# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix - CRITICAL STEPS

## The Problem
Your GitHub Actions workflow is failing with these errors:
- "Get Pages site failed"
- "Resource not accessible by integration"
- "The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128"

These errors occur because GitHub Pages needs specific permissions and configuration settings.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/StevieSimsII/AiNewsDaily
2. Click on **Settings** (tab at the top)
3. On the left sidebar, under "Code and automation", click on **Pages**
4. Under "Build and deployment", for **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - This is the most critical step!

### Step 2: Set Required Permissions

1. Still in Settings, click on **Actions** in the left sidebar, then **General**
2. Scroll down to "Workflow permissions"
3. Select **Read and write permissions**
4. Check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Re-Run the Failed Workflow

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Find the failed workflow run (should be at the top)
3. Click on it
4. Click the **Re-run all jobs** button in the top-right corner

## What's Been Fixed

We've updated your repository with:

1. **Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow file** with:
   - Full permissions for deployments
   - Explicit GitHub Pages enablement
   - A proper build and deploy process

2. **Automatic date updating in the web app**:
   - The OneClickUpdate.ps1 script now updates the date in the website footer

## Checking Deployment Status

After completing these steps:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a new workflow run in progress
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
4. Visit your site at https://steviesimsii.github.io/AiNewsDaily/
5. Verify that the "Last Updated" date matches today's date

## If Issues Persist

If you continue to see errors after following these steps:

1. Go to repository **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Make sure the **Source** is set to **GitHub Actions**
3. Check the **Actions** tab for detailed error messages
4. Try running the updated OneClickUpdate.ps1 script again

Once this is fixed, your normal update process will work smoothly going forward.
