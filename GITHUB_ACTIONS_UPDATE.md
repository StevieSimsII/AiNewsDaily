# GitHub Actions Version Update

## Issue Fixed: Deprecated Action Version

The workflow was failing with this error:
```
This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.
```

## Updates Made

We've updated all GitHub Action versions in your workflow files to the latest available versions:

1. **In `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`**:
   - Updated `actions/checkout` from v3 to v4
   - Updated `actions/configure-pages` from v3 to v4
   - Updated `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from v2 to v4
   - Updated `actions/deploy-pages` from v2 to v4

2. **In `.github/workflows/pages.yml`**:
   - Recreated the file with all latest action versions
   - Fixed YAML formatting issues

## Benefits of Using Latest Versions

1. **Security Improvements**:
   - Latest versions include security patches
   - Reduced vulnerability to potential exploits

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Newer versions typically have better performance
   - More efficient handling of artifacts

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Access to new features and capabilities
   - Better compatibility with GitHub's infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update GitHub Actions to latest versions"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Monitor the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab

3. Verify your site is properly deployed at https://steviesimsii.github.io/AiNewsDaily/

## Staying Updated

GitHub regularly updates their actions. To stay informed about action deprecations:

1. Watch the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/)
2. Consider setting up a dependabot.yml file to automatically update your actions

This update should resolve the action deprecation error and ensure your GitHub Pages deployment works correctly.
